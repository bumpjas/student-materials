# Title
Seven Praises
## Executive Summary I am looking to make a app based n this scripture out of the Passion Translation Bible. Pslam 119:164  I stop to praise you seven times a day, all because your ways are perfect!
  This will be an app to sed out reminders seven times a day with the sound clip or music clip that the user will choose.  it is based on the above scripture that says to praise the Lord seven times.
  I will be posting links to videos to help you in this process also. And articles n how to do this also.



## Business Objectives
This will be a free app becuase the scripture says in 
Matthew 10:8 8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.  It will have an opyton to reciev free will offerings to support the coder and designer if they wish.

## Background

I am doing this project just to encourage fellow believers. 1 Thessalonians 4:18 18Therefore encourage one another with these words. I am also looking to encourage my self. 1 Samuel 30:6 6And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.


## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*

## Personnel requirements

I am looking to have a 3 to 4 member team working on this.  I am plannung on using Github to work together. this wil hve 
*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
